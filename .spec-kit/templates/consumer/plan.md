# Plan

## Implementation Start Gate
- Implementation tasks MUST remain unchecked until `SPEC_READY=true`.
- If required inputs are missing, add `BLOCKED_MISSING_INPUTS` in `spec.md` and keep the gate closed.

## Constitution Gates (Pre-Implementation)
- Simplicity gate:
  - Keep initial implementation scope minimal and explicit.
  - Avoid speculative future-proof abstractions.
- Anti-abstraction gate:
  - Prefer direct framework primitives over wrapper layers unless justified.
  - Keep model representations singular unless boundary separation is required.
- Integration-first testing gate:
  - Define contract and boundary tests before implementation details.
  - Ensure realistic environment coverage for integration points.

## Work Slices
1. Slice 1
2. Slice 2

## Validation Plan
- Unit:
- Contract:
- Integration:
- E2E:

## App Onboarding Contract (Normative)
- Required minimum make targets:
  - `apps-bootstrap`
  - `apps-smoke`
  - `backend-test-unit`
  - `backend-test-integration`
  - `backend-test-contracts`
  - `backend-test-e2e`
  - `touchpoints-test-unit`
  - `touchpoints-test-integration`
  - `touchpoints-test-contracts`
  - `touchpoints-test-e2e`
  - `test-unit-all`
  - `test-integration-all`
  - `test-contracts-all`
  - `test-e2e-all-local`
  - `infra-port-forward-start`
  - `infra-port-forward-stop`
  - `infra-port-forward-cleanup`
- App onboarding impact: no-impact | impacted (select one)
- Notes:

## Documentation Plan (Document Phase)
- Platform docs updates:
- Mermaid diagrams updated:
- Docs validation commands:
  - `make docs-build`
  - `make docs-smoke`

## Publish Preparation
- PR context file:
  - `pr_context.md`
- Hardening review file:
  - `hardening_review.md`
- Publish checklist:
  - include requirement/contract coverage
  - include key reviewer files
  - include validation evidence + rollback notes

## Operability Plan
- Runbook updates:
- Monitoring/alerting updates:
