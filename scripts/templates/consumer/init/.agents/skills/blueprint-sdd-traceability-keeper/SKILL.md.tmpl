# Blueprint SDD Traceability Keeper

## When to Use
Use this skill during planning, implementation, and pre-merge hardening to ensure no requirement loses coverage.

## Guardrails
1. Every `REQ-###` must map to at least one spec statement.
2. Every implemented requirement must map to at least one automated test.
3. Every changed behavior must map to docs updates when user-facing or operationally relevant.
4. Report unmapped items as blocking gaps.

## Workflow
1. Read `traceability.md` for each active work item.
2. Verify links across:
   - `REQ-###` -> `spec.md`
   - `spec.md` -> code path(s)
   - code path(s) -> test assertion(s)
   - behavior change -> docs path(s)
3. Flag orphan requirements, orphan tests, and undocumented behavior changes.
4. Update traceability tables and evidence links.
5. Re-run SDD governance checks.

## Useful Commands
```bash
make quality-sdd-check
make quality-sdd-check-all
```

## Required Report Format
Return:
1. Work items inspected.
2. Coverage summary (`REQ`, code, tests, docs).
3. Blocking traceability gaps.
4. Drift fixes applied.
5. Residual risks.
