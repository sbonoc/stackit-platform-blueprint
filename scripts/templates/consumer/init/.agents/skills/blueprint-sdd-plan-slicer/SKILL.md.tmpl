# Blueprint SDD Plan Slicer

## When to Use
Use this skill once a spec has passed clarification and is ready to be planned for delivery.

## Guardrails
1. Slice by bounded context and dependency direction, not by random files.
2. Keep each slice independently verifiable.
3. Preserve ownership boundaries from `blueprint/contract.yaml`.
4. Keep traceability from `REQ-###` to tasks explicit.
5. Update backlog links/status together with plan updates.

## Workflow
1. Load the approved spec set (`SPEC_READY=true`).
2. Derive execution slices with clear inputs/outputs.
3. Assign owner per slice and identify dependency edges.
4. Define validation per slice (lowest valid test layer first).
5. Update `plan.md` and `tasks.md` for each spec.
6. Synchronize `AGENTS.backlog.md` with links to the plan/tasks sections.

## Useful Commands
```bash
make quality-sdd-check
make quality-hooks-fast
```

## Required Report Format
Return:
1. Specs processed.
2. Slice list (ordered).
3. Owner and dependency map per slice.
4. Validation strategy per slice.
5. Backlog updates performed.
6. Critical risks and mitigations.
