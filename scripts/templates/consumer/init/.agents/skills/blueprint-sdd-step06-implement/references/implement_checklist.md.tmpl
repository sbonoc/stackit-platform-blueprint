# Implementation Checklist

- Confirm SPEC_READY: true is set in spec.md before writing any code.
- Follow slice order defined in plan.md.
- For each slice:
  - Write ALL failing tests first — confirm each fails with expected error.
  - Do not write implementation code before confirming tests fail.
  - Write implementation to make tests pass.
  - Run targeted tests — confirm all pass.
  - Run full suite — confirm no regressions.
  - Mark tasks [x] in tasks.md.
  - Commit red tests and green implementation as separate commits.
- For filter/payload-transform changes: positive-path assertions with matching fixture values required.
- For HTTP route/query scope: run make test-smoke-all-local and record pass/fail in pr_context.md.
- Translate reproducible pre-commit failures into failing tests first, then fix.
- All commits go to the existing Draft PR branch.
- Confirm no new PR was opened.
