# Blueprint SDD PR Packager

## When to Use
Use this skill after `Verify -> Document -> Operate` to complete the `Publish` phase before opening a PR.

## Guardrails
1. Do not publish without `hardening_review.md` and `pr_context.md` updated.
2. Ensure PR description headings match repository pull-request template.
3. Keep reviewer context deterministic: requirement IDs, key files, validation evidence, risk/rollback, deferred proposals.
4. Do not implement deferred proposals in this phase.

## Workflow
1. Refresh PR context artifact from current work-item files.
2. Validate hardening review sections are present and complete.
3. Prepare PR description using template-equivalent headings.
4. Cross-check key reviewer file list against changed files.
5. Report publish readiness and remaining blockers.

## Canonical Commands
```bash
make spec-pr-context
make quality-hardening-review
make quality-sdd-check
```

## Required Report Format
Return:
1. `pr_context.md` path and update status.
2. `hardening_review.md` status and section completeness.
3. Proposed PR description headings and filled summary.
4. Key reviewer files list.
5. Remaining blockers to publish.
