# Implementation Checklist

- Confirm SPEC_READY: true is set in spec.md before writing any code.
- Read Implementation Stack Profile from spec.md (backend stack, frontend stack, test automation profile).
- Determine test commands: prefer canonical Make targets; use raw test runner as fallback for new apps.
- Follow slice order defined in plan.md.
- For each slice:
  - Write ALL failing tests first — confirm each fails with expected error.
  - Do not write implementation code before confirming tests fail.
  - Write implementation to make tests pass.
  - Run targeted tests — confirm all pass (make backend-test-unit or make touchpoints-test-unit).
  - Run full unit suite — confirm no regressions (make test-unit-all).
  - Mark tasks [x] in tasks.md.
  - Commit red tests and green implementation as separate commits.
- For filter/payload-transform changes: positive-path assertions with matching fixture values required.
- For HTTP route/query scope: run make test-smoke-all-local and record pass/fail in pr_context.md.
- Translate reproducible pre-commit failures into failing tests first, then fix.
- Run minimum validation bundle for the change type declared in spec.md.
- All commits go to the existing Draft PR branch.
- Confirm no new PR was opened.
